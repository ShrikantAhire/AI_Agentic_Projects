# 🤖 AI Agentic Projects Lab

Welcome to the **AI Agentic Projects** repository!  
This is my personal learning lab where I explore and build hands-on projects using the latest agentic AI frameworks like:

- 🔗 [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)
- 📚 [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/)
- 🔄 [LangGraph](https://langgraph.dev/)
- 🤖 Coming soon: AutoGen, CrewAI and more!
